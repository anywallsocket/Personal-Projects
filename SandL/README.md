# Snakes and Ladders

### Here we implement snakes and ladders (S&L) boardgame
This is to study transition matricies and discrete time event simulations

The following features are implemented:
* NxN grid
* S snakes, and L ladders
* snakes and ladders cannot share starting points
* snakes and ladders can share ending points
* Adjacency and Transition matricicies generation
* Plots for visualizing the boardgame

Thereafter, mild analysis is provided.

### Notebooks part1 and part2 explore more thoroughly this development
