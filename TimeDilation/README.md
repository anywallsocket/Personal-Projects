  This code plots the total time dilation of a clock relative to a ground clock,
  as a function of their relative velocity and radii. 
  This total dilation is the product of kinetic and potential dilation.
  The ISS and a GPS satellite are plotted for reference.
  Additionally, the line of zero dilation (relative to ground clock),
  and the line of escape velocity are also plotted for analysis.
  It is seen that the ground-level escape velocity (purely kinetic) exactly matches
  the asymptote for zero dilation, establishing conversion to purely potential.

How to interpret:

For example, we see that the GPS reads ~ + 38 microsecond dilation per day.
This means that, relative to us, its clocks are 38 microseconds ahead (older).

Likewise we see that the ISS reads ~ -26 microsecond dilation per day.
This means that, relative to us, its clocks are 26 microseconds behind (younger).

The discrepancy is understood by realizing that, relative to us: 
The GPS is much farther out of the Earth's gravity well, so its clocks are not slowed as much as ours.
The ISS is deep in Earth's gravity well just like us, so its velocity slows its clocks even more than ours.

Therefore the z-axis can be interpreted as microseconds faster (positive) and microseconds slower (negative).
